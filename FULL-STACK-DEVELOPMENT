Full Stack + AI: 120-Day, 2 Hours/Day Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1–30)
Programming Basics (Python & JavaScript)

Days 1–10: Python syntax, data types, functions, OOP, basic file I/O.

Days 11–15: JavaScript syntax, DOM, simple scripting in browsers.

Web Development Basics

Days 16–22: HTML, CSS, responsive design, CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind).

Days 23–25: Dev tools, code editors, Git basics.

Practice: Build a simple static website portfolio.

Phase 2: Core Full Stack (Days 31–60)
Frontend Framework (React recommended)

Days 31–40: React fundamentals—components, props, state, event handling.

Days 41–45: Routing, hooks, consuming APIs, component libraries (Chakra, Material-UI).

Backend Framework (Node.js/Express OR Flask for Python)

Days 46–52: Setting up servers, REST APIs, handling requests, middleware.

Days 53–55: Authentication basics, MVC pattern.

Databases

Days 56–60: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)—schema design, CRUD; NoSQL (MongoDB) basics.

Phase 3: AI & Machine Learning Foundations (Days 61–90)
Math and ML Concepts

Days 61–68: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices), probability, calculus (for ML intuition).

Days 69–75: Data processing with Pandas & NumPy.

Machine Learning Essentials (scikit-learn)

Days 76–80: Regression, classification algorithms, data splitting, model training/testing.

Days 81–85: Deep learning basics (neural nets)—intro to TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Days 86–90: Natural language processing (NLP) with HuggingFace Transformers or NLTK.

Phase 4: AI Integration & Real Projects (Days 91–120)
Integrate AI into Web Apps

Days 91–95: Build and expose ML models via REST APIs (Flask/FastAPI).

Days 96–102: Connect APIs to frontend apps—display predictions, visualizations.

Cloud Deployment & DevOps

Days 103–108: Deploy app (and model) to cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure/Streamlit/Heroku.

Days 109–112: Version control (GitHub), CI/CD basics.

Capstone Projects & Portfolio

Days 113–120: Pick a project (see ideas below), build and polish for portfolio. Add documentation, prepare a GitHub README.

Example projects:

AI-powered blog or product recommender

Chatbot integrated to a React or Flask app

Image classifier demo site

Sentiment analysis dashboard

Tips for Success
Document your progress: Use a GitHub repo or a blog.

Supplement with video lectures: (YouTube, Coursera, etc.)

Join developer communities: (Stack Overflow, Discord, Reddit) for support and feedback.

Iterate on projects: Tweak, add features, and reflect on what you’ve learned

If you want an even more granular daily or weekly breakdown with specific online resources (e.g., best free courses or YouTube playlists), let me know your current level (beginner/intermediate) and preferred stack (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)—I can tailor the plan further!
